## Provider-neutral message format
```ts
type Role = 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant';
interface Message {
  id: string; conversationId: string; seq: number;   // seq preserves order
  role: Role; content: string;                       // text only for launch
  modelId?: string;                                  // which model wrote an assistant message
  status: 'complete' | 'partial' | 'error';
  createdAt: string;
}
interface ProviderAdapter {
  id: 'openai' | 'anthropic' | 'google' | 'xai';
  toProviderRequest(history: Message[], model: ModelConfig, maxOutput: number): unknown;
  stream(req: unknown, signal: AbortSignal): AsyncIterable<{ delta?: string; usage?: Usage }>;
  normalizeUsage(raw: unknown): Usage;   // input, output, cached, reasoning tokens
  normalizeError(e: unknown): ProviderError; // timeout | rate_limit | auth | unavailable | unknown
}
```
Each adapter maps roles to its own API format. For example, Anthropic and Google take the system prompt separately, and Google calls the assistant role `model`. Replies from other models are passed as `assistant` turns, in order.

## Context policy
Walk history from newest to oldest and keep messages until we hit `min(model.contextWindow, budgetCap) - maxOutput - safetyMargin`. Always keep the system prompt and the newest user message. If older messages were dropped, set a flag so the UI can show "Older messages not included."

## Data model (Postgres, RLS on every table)
- `profiles(user_id, email, email_verified, plan, status)`
- `conversations(id, user_id, title, created_at, updated_at)`
- `messages(id, conversation_id, seq, role, content, model_id, status, created_at)`
- `budgets(user_id, period_start, allowance_cents, spent_cents, reserved_cents)`
- `ledger(id, user_id, request_id UNIQUE, model_id, reserved_cents, actual_cents, input_tokens, output_tokens, reasoning_tokens, cached_tokens, state, created_at)`. `state` is one of `reserved | settled | uncertain | released`.
- `settings(key, value)`: global spending stop, provider enabled flags
- `payment_events(event_id UNIQUE, ...)`: later, makes repeated events safe to process

Store money as integer micro-cents (or numeric) to avoid float rounding.

## Request flow (server only)
1. Auth: valid session, email verified, and the domain is exactly `uwo.ca`.
2. Ownership: the conversation belongs to the user.
3. Gates: the global stop is off, the provider is enabled, the model is allowed for this plan, and the rate limit passes.
4. Build context (policy above). Estimate the cost upper bound: `input_tokens × in_price + maxOutput (incl. reasoning) × out_price`.
5. **Atomic reserve.** In one SQL statement or function:
   `UPDATE budgets SET reserved = reserved + :bound WHERE user_id=:u AND allowance - spent - reserved >= :bound RETURNING ...`
   If no row comes back, either lower `maxOutput` to fit or reject with a budget-pause message. Insert the ledger row with `state='reserved'` and an idempotent `request_id`.
6. Save the user message, then stream from the provider.
7. **Reconcile** with the usage the provider reports: move `reserved → spent` at the actual cost and release the rest.
   - Client disconnects: keep reading the provider stream on the server until it finishes, or charge the full reservation.
   - No usage reported or unknown outcome: mark `uncertain` and keep the full reservation charged until it's reviewed.
   - Retry: same `request_id`, so it can't be charged twice and can't create duplicate messages.
8. Save the assistant message with its `modelId` and `status`.

## Admin and operations
- Admin page (Jake): spend by user and model, total cost, error counts, the global stop toggle, provider toggles.
- Logs: request ID, user ID, model, tokens, cost, error code. **Never message content.**
- Backups: Supabase daily backups. Roll back a bad release with Vercel instant rollback.

## Security checklist
Keys only in server env. RLS plus server checks on every read and write. Exact domain match after normalization (lowercase, trim; reject unicode lookalikes). CSRF and auth on all mutation routes. Rate-limit OTP sends.
