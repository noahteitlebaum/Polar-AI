# Product Spec — Polar AI (Launch v1)

**Launch:** Mon Oct 19 2026 · **Audience:** Western students with a verified @uwo.ca email
**Owners:** Noah (tech) · Jake (economics, priorities, testing) · Natan (outreach, onboarding, support)

## Goal
One mobile-friendly web app where a student can chat with models from four providers, switch models mid-conversation, and keep the full context.

## Launch requirements
1. **Access.** Sign in with email OTP. Only verified addresses at the exact `uwo.ca` domain get access or credits. (This checks email ownership, not enrolment.)
2. **Models.** At least one clearly named model from each provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI. Exact models and prices must be checked against official docs before we promise them publicly. *(TBD: list in `src/config/models.ts`)*
3. **Chat.** Saved text conversations: list, open, rename, delete. Streaming replies. Each assistant message shows the model that wrote it.
4. **Model switching.** Change the model in the same chat. The new model gets the earlier history, including replies from other models.
5. **Context policy.** Long chats use an explicit, disclosed limit: send the most recent N tokens of history that fit the model's window and the budget reserve, and show a notice in the UI when older messages are left out. Never claim unlimited memory.
6. **Usage and limits.** A dollar budget for each user (not a message count). Show used and remaining. Pause generation with a clear explanation when the remaining budget can't cover a request.
7. **Status.** The UI clearly shows trial or subscription status.
8. **Controls.** Per-user rate limits, a team-wide spending stop, a disable switch for each provider.
9. **Reporting.** Admin view or report for Jake: spend by user and model, total API cost, errors. No message content.
10. **UX states.** Sending, streaming, waiting, errors, rate limits and budget pauses all make sense on phone and desktop.

## Deferred
- **Post-launch roadmap:** model comparison, in-app images, smart model selection, more models.
- **Optional, only after launch checks pass:** PDFs, web search, course folders, preferences, memory across chats.

## Core journey (the first thing to build end to end)
Verify email → start a chat → get a reply → switch model → ask a follow-up that relies on earlier context → refresh and reopen the chat (history and model labels still there).

## Open questions
- Which exact model from each provider is live at launch?
- How many simultaneous users can we safely invite? (Measure this before launch.)
- Who covers Oct 17–19, and when?
