# AGENTS.md — Polar AI

Read this first in every AI session. Also read `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/TASKS.md`. If anything here conflicts with a direct instruction from Noah, follow Noah and update this file.

## What this is
A mobile-friendly web app that gives verified @uwo.ca students one place to use OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini) and xAI (Grok). Each AI app (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) has its own chat list; inside a chat, students can switch between that app's models and keep the context. Chats never carry over between apps (Noah, Oct 2026); courses (files + instructions) are shared by all four apps. **Launch: Monday Oct 19 2026.**

## Stack (provisional; change it here if it changes)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth (email OTP), Row Level Security
- Vercel hosting (preview deploy for each branch)
- Provider SDKs called **only from server code** (route handlers / server actions)
- Tests: Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (core journey on phone and desktop)

## Commands
```
npm run dev        # local dev
npm run lint       # eslint
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # vitest (mock providers, no live API calls)
npm run test:e2e   # playwright
npm run test:live  # small opt-in live checks against all 4 providers (costs money)
```
(Add a script to package.json if it doesn't exist yet.)

## Hard rules (never violate)
1. **API keys stay on the server.** Never send them to the client, logs, or prompts. Use env vars only.
2. **Access:** only users who have verified an email at the exact domain `uwo.ca` may get credits or call a model. Enforce this on the server, not just in the UI. Reject subdomains and lookalike domains (`uwo.ca.evil.com`, `xuwo.ca`, unicode lookalikes).
2a. **Waitlist:** while `WAITLIST_MODE` is on, only emails in `EARLY_ACCESS_EMAILS` reach the app; everyone else sees `/waitlist`. Enforce with `getUserAccess()` on every page and API route that uses models.
3. **Ownership:** a user can only read or write their own conversations. Enforce with RLS **and** server checks.
4. **Budget:** every model call does an atomic reserve → call → reconcile against a dollar budget (see ARCHITECTURE.md). Don't make a provider call without a reservation.
5. **No silent model substitution.** If a provider fails, show an error and let the student choose another model.
6. **No silent history dropping.** Use the disclosed context policy for long chats.
7. **Privacy:** never log message content. Log IDs, model, token counts, cost, error codes.
8. **Config, not code:** model IDs, prices, allowances, rate limits and feature flags live in `src/config/`. Adding a provider should only need a new adapter plus config.
9. **Payments stay disabled** (`PAYMENTS_ENABLED=false`) until Jake gives the final rules.
10. Use synthetic accounts and data only. Never use real student chats in prompts, tests or screenshots.

## Out of scope for launch (don't build unless the team agrees)
Model comparison, smart model routing, connectors (Drive/GitHub…), coding/computer agents, web search, code execution, voice, saved memories.
**Built (Noah + Jake's backend memo, Oct 2026):** file/image uploads with page references, courses (shared by all four apps: instructions + reusable files), grounded answers with [S#] sources and a "use only my course material" switch, study modes (explain / quiz me / hints), running summaries for long chats, low-balance warning with a cheaper-model offer, image generation (Gemini, Grok; OpenAI once its price is set). Everything that calls a model goes through the same reserve → call → settle budget path.

## Where things live (server)
- `supabase/migrations/0001_core.sql`, `0002_files_courses.sql` — tables, RLS, budget functions (secret key only), `search_chunks` keyword search, private `uploads` + `generated` buckets. Money is in micros (millionths of $).
- `lib/providers/*` — one adapter per provider (fetch + SSE, no SDKs; text + image input). `LIVE_MODELS=on` turns on real calls; otherwise demo replies at no cost.
- `lib/files/extract.ts` — PDF (per page) / DOCX / TXT text extraction and chunking; scanned PDFs are flagged `needs_ocr`, never silently accepted. `lib/files/upload-client.ts` uploads browser → Storage directly (avoids Vercel's 4.5 MB request limit), then `POST /api/files` indexes it.
- `lib/chat/context.ts` — context policy, cost maths, system prompt (modes, course material, course-only). `lib/chat/material.ts` — picks passages ([S#]) from chat attachments + course files and loads images for vision. `lib/chat/summary.ts` — running summary of messages that no longer fit (cheapest model, budgeted).
- `app/api/chat` (NDJSON stream), `app/api/files`, `app/api/images`, `app/api/conversations`, `app/api/projects` (courses), `app/api/usage`.
- `config/models.ts` — model ids, prices, context caps, image models. Prices checked Oct 5 2026; re-check before launch.
- Sources shown to students are only passages the answer actually cited and that were really sent (`citedSources`).

## How to work
- One bounded task at a time, taken from `docs/TASKS.md`, with acceptance criteria.
- Read the relevant code before changing it. Plan multi-file changes first.
- Run `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` before saying a task is done.
- Report: files changed, checks run, unresolved issues.
- Commit each verified increment with a clear message.
- Get a second-model review before merging auth, context transfer, cost accounting or payment changes.

## Definition of done
- Acceptance criteria met and covered by tests (mock providers).
- Works at phone width (375px) and on desktop.
- Server-side enforcement exists for any access, ownership or budget rule touched.
- No secrets or message content in logs.
- Docs updated if a decision changed.

## UI theme
All styling uses the Polar AI design system ("Polar Night" dark default, "Polar Day" light), defined as CSS variables in `app/globals.css` and exposed as Tailwind utilities (`bg-surface-100`, `text-ink-muted`, `border-line`, `bg-brand`, `text-on-brand`, `bg-provider-anthropic`, `shadow-card`…). Never use Tailwind palette colors (zinc, red…) or raw hex in components. Brand pieces (`Wordmark`, `OrbitBackdrop`, `ProviderDot`) live in `components/brand.tsx`; logo PNGs in `public/brand/`. Provider colors are dots beside the model name.

**Chat themes (Noah's decision, Oct 2026):** the chat screen has a left rail with each AI app's logo (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok). Picking one opens that app's own chat list and re-skins the chat to look like that app: `data-theme="<provider>"` on the chat root re-points the tokens (colors, fonts) in `app/globals.css`; layout differences (greeting, composer/bubble shapes, reply font, disclaimer) live in `config/themes.ts`. The model menu in the message box (`components/model-menu.tsx`) lists only that app's models from `config/models.ts`. Logos are files in `public/providers/` set via `logo` in `config/themes.ts`. Auth pages and the rest of the app stay on Polar Night/Day.
